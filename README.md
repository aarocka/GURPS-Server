# GURPS-Server
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rainbowdash/GURPS-Server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rainbowdash/GURPS-Server)
This is the server side backend for our gurps app.
It uses the power of swift because this needs to be made into a viable full stack
lang. Pubnub is used for push notifications.
